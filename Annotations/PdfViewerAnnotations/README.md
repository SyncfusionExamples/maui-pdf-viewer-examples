# Working with Annotations in .NET MAUI PDF Viewer

This repository provides an example of how to add, edit, remove, and manage annotations in a PDF document using the **Syncfusion .NET MAUI PDF Viewer**, allowing users to interactively modify annotations within a PDF.

## Process behind PDF annotation management

The sample demonstrates how annotations can be programmatically created and modified directly within the loaded PDF document. Users can add highlight annotations to specific text areas, change annotation properties such as color and opacity, remove existing annotations, and use undo/redo actions to manage recent annotation changes.

## Steps to use the sample

1. Run the application to load a sample PDF document embedded in the project.
2. Use the toolbar buttons to perform various annotation actions:
   - **Add Annotation**: Inserts a new highlight annotation on a specified page location.
   - **Remove Annotation**: Removes a specific annotation from the document.
   - **Edit Annotation**: Changes the appearance of an existing annotation.
   - **Undo Annotation**: Reverts the most recent annotation change.
   - **Redo Annotation**: Re-applies the last undone annotation change.
