# Electronic Signatures in .NET MAUI PDF Viewer

This repository provides an example of how to add electronic signatures in a PDF document using the Syncfusion .NET MAUI PDF Viewer. It demonstrates how users can interactively insert handwritten, image-based, and freehand signatures into a PDF file.

## Process behind PDF signature integration

The sample showcases how different types of signatures can be programmatically added to a loaded PDF document. Users can enable signature mode for freehand input, insert predefined handwritten signatures using ink points, and embed image-based signatures at specific locations. These features allow for flexible and interactive signing experiences within the application.

Signature types supported in this sample:
- **Handwritten Signature**: A predefined ink stroke rendered on the PDF.
- **Image Signature**: A signature image embedded at a specified location.
- **Freehand Signature**: User-drawn signature using touch or mouse input.

## Steps to use the sample

1. Run the application to load a sample PDF document embedded in the project.
2. Use the toolbar buttons to perform signature actions:
   - **Add Signature**: Enables freehand signature mode for user input.
   - **Add Handwritten Signature**: Inserts a predefined ink signature on a specified page.
   - **Add Image Signature**: Embeds a signature image at a defined location on the PDF.

This sample demonstrates how to integrate electronic signature capabilities into your .NET MAUI application using Syncfusion's PDF Viewer control.
